  <h2>Explain: a tool for exploring Maxent models</h2>
  Written by Steven Phillips, with support from 
  AT&amp;T Labs-Research.
</span>
  <p>The explain tool shows how an additive Maxent model (i.e., one
  made without product features) is composed of separate contributions
  from each predictor variable.

<p>
  Click on the map to get data for a single point.  The corresponding
  point is shown on the response curve for each predictor variable on
  the right.

<p>
  The plot labeled "Contribution to logit" shows the breakdown of the
  logit of the Maxent prediction, giving the contribution of each
  variable.  The variables that are most limiting (having most
  negative logit) or most supportive of presence of the species
  (having most positive logit) can be readily seen from in this plot.

<p>
  To zoom in on the map, sweep out an area with the mouse.  The map
  can also be shifted or zoomed using the navigation buttons at the
  top left.
